the science, biology, reproduction, ecologty, law, geopolitics, sociology and economics of space settlement, only to find themselves deeply sceptical of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight, the lack of reproductive biology research in space,
the legal vacuum that governs off-Earth territory, covering existing treaties on Earth and analysing self-determination, territorial integrity
and the geopolitical issues that permanent settlements would have to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Orbital</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2025/orbital/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2025/orbital/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 2024 Booker Prize, this novel follows six astronauts over 24 hours on the International Space Station, over 16 orbits, which centres on the evolving devastating storm in the Philippines focusing on the relationships of the Austronaurs and Cosmonauts aboard the ISS and of their family on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just over 120 pages, suggesting the novel can be read rather quickly, in fact requires a careful consideration, making it a profound meditative experience, highlighting just how fragile our planet and our human connections are.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
