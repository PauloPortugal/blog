&lt;p&gt;There are echos of Orwell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Animal Farm&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;1984&amp;rdquo; and captures a chilling landscape of political turmoil that resonates
deeply with today&amp;rsquo;s sociopolitical climate, especially in the context of the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s second term and recent events in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynch&amp;rsquo;s stylistic writing has no paragraph breaks and dialogue without quotation marks which reminded me of the Portuguese Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Orbital</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2025/orbital/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2025/orbital/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 2024 Booker Prize, this novel follows six astronauts over 24 hours on the International Space Station, over 16 orbits, which centres on the evolving devastating storm in the Philippines focusing on the relationships of the Austronaurs and Cosmonauts aboard the ISS and of their family on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just over 120 pages, suggesting the novel can be read rather quickly, in fact requires a careful consideration, making it a profound meditative experience, highlighting just how fragile our planet and our human connections are.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Gospel According to Jesus Christ</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/o-evangelho-segundo-jesus-cristo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/o-evangelho-segundo-jesus-cristo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Published in 1991, this is one of Saramago&amp;rsquo;s masterpieces – written in his characteristic style (no paragraph breaks, dialogue without quotation marks), the work is a profoundly philosophical and provocative reimagining of the life of Christ, portraying Jesus as a humanized and imperfect character with passions and doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel delves into profound theological questions: the problem of evil, the nature of a God portrayed as power-hungry and indifferent to human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Esteiros</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/esteiros/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/esteiros/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Estuaries&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the founding texts of Portuguese neorealism, published in 1941 and censored by the Estado Novo regime, it is a masterpiece of social criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel tells the harsh story of lower-class boys who, due to their social status, are forced to work in a small brick factory instead of studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to &amp;ldquo;The sons of men who were never children,&amp;rdquo; it is a devastating critique of the social conditions of the Estado Novo era and its numerous inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Amor Estragado</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/amor-estragado/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/amor-estragado/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tainted Love&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disturbing and necessary novel that explores domestic violence from the chilling perspective of the aggressor who justifies and legitimizes his acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two brothers narrate the story of a family&amp;rsquo;s dissolution. Pedrosa&amp;rsquo;s writing is colloquial, simple, and devastatingly direct, hitting like a punch in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intense, uncomfortable, and necessary reading that affirms Ana Bárbara Pedrosa as a serious force in contemporary Portuguese literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
