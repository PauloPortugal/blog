the science, biology, reproduction, ecologty, law, geopolitics, sociology and economics of space settlement, only to find themselves deeply sceptical of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the physiological effects of long-duration spaceflight, the lack of reproductive biology research in space,
the legal vacuum that governs off-Earth territory, covering existing treaties on Earth and analysing self-determination, territorial integrity
and the geopolitical issues that permanent settlements would have to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2025/sapiens/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2025/sapiens/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This ia a groundbreaking narrative of humanity&amp;rsquo;s creation and evolution that became a global phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harari argues that Homo Sapiens&amp;rsquo; rise to dominance stemmed from our ability to create fictional constructs and how they shape human societies, focusing on three key elements: religion, nations, and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His provocative claim that the Agricultural Revolution, the transition from Foraging to Farming, was for a brief time a painful hurdle our conventional thinking.
He also emphasizes the critical role of storytelling and sharing narratives in the evolution of our species.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>D. Manuel II</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/d-manuel-ii/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/d-manuel-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 2022 Grémio Literário Prize, this biography explores the life of the last king of Portugal, D. Manuel II, whose reign was marked by tragedy from its very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of 18, motivated by the regicide, he was thrust onto the throne during one of Portugal&amp;rsquo;s most turbulent periods, reigning for only two years before the republic was proclaimed in 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biography illuminates not only Manuel&amp;rsquo;s personal story, but also the final days of the Portuguese monarchy and the socio-political forces that led to its downfall.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/zero-to-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/zero-to-one/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A modern classic that forces you to sharpen your thinking about startups, business and the future, based on Thiel&amp;rsquo;s legendary CS183 class at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core concept is powerful: progress from &amp;ldquo;zero to one&amp;rdquo; (creating something entirely new) rather than &amp;ldquo;one to n&amp;rdquo; (incremental improvement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiel makes the provocative contrarian case for monopoly over competition, arguing that competition kills profits while monopolies can afford to think long-term and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conquerors: How Portugal Forged the First Global Empire</title><link>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/conquerors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pauloportugal.github.io/books/2024/conquerors/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A gripping chronicle of Portugal&amp;rsquo;s violent trajectory from a secondary nation to European power, dominating the spice trade and building the first global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowley masterfully narrates the first 30 years of Portuguese seafaring in the Indian Ocean (early 1500s), from Vasco da Gama&amp;rsquo;s discovery of the sea route to India to the death of Afonso de Albuquerque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is both a high seas adventure and a nuanced examination of Portuguese bravery, curiosity, cruelty, greed and not shying away from the horrific violence that characterized Portugal&amp;rsquo;s imperial conquest over Muslim rulers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
