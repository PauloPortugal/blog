## About Me

Hi, I'm Paulo Monteiro, a software engineer based in Leeds, England

I hold an MSc in Big Data and Machine Learning from Birkbeck, University of London, where I specialized in statistical learning, cloud computing, and data warehousing. My coursework included building systems with R, Hadoop MapReduce on AWS, and developing recurrent neural networks for medical image analysis.

Lately I am having a blast with Claude Code, experimenting with MCP servers and AI agents, including helping me create and maintain this blog.

### Professional Focus

I work with backend systems, infrastructure automation, and distributed architectures. My technical interests span:

- **Backend Development**: Java (+18 years experience), Go (+2 years experience), Node.js (+3 years experience) and Golang
- **Data Engineering**: Big Data analytics, machine learning, data warehousing
- **Infrastructure**: Ansible, Terraform, Linux provisioning, Cloud computing
- **Databases**: MongoDB, NoSQL solutions, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MySQL
- **APIs & Frameworks**: Gin Gonic, Dropwizard, REST architecture
- **AI Tools**: Claude Code

### Open Source

I maintain several open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/PauloPortugal), including:

- **manjaro-playbook**: Manjaro/Arch Linux Ansible provision playbook
- **gin-gonic-rest-mongodb**: REST API implementations with Go and MongoDB
- **dropwizard-guice-mongodb**: NoSQL JPA solutions with Dropwizard


### Hobbies

I'm passionate about rugby and support the [Lobos](https://fpr.pt/) 🇵🇹🐺 (Portuguese National team), [CDUP](https://www.cdup.pt/),  [Springboks](https://springboks.rugby/) 🇿🇦, and [Vodacom Bulls](https://bullsrugby.co.za/).
As a sports enthusiast, I am also an [FC Porto](https://www.fcporto.pt/), [NY Knicks](https://nba.com/knicks), [NY Mets](https://www.mlb.com/mets) and [Yorkshire CCC](https://yorkshireccc.com/) cricket fan.

As far as music tastes go, I love jazz, blues and thrash metal fan as well as sci-fi dystopian film soundtracks and I love playing guitar on my free time.

I grew up watching [Spaghetti Westerns and even did a presentation about it](https://prezi.com/view/Te7Gyx4CUjJUi08NE31R/?referral_token=ASl0RFlnB3FN) and in my adult years the space exploration and dystopian movies have caught my interest.

I am also an avid book reader and an [amateur chess player](https://www.chess.com/member/pmonteiro).


### Languages

I speak Portuguese (native), English (fluent), and Spanish (conversational).
