Winner of the 2022 Grémio Literário Prize, this biography explores the life of the last king of Portugal, D. Manuel II, whose reign was marked by tragedy from its very beginning.

At the age of 18, motivated by the regicide, he was thrust onto the throne during one of Portugal's most turbulent periods, reigning for only two years before the republic was proclaimed in 1910.

The biography illuminates not only Manuel's personal story, but also the final days of the Portuguese monarchy and the socio-political forces that led to its downfall.
