A modern classic that forces you to sharpen your thinking about startups, business and the future, based on Thiel's legendary CS183 class at Stanford University.

The core concept is powerful: progress from "zero to one" (creating something entirely new) rather than "one to n" (incremental improvement).

Thiel makes the provocative contrarian case for monopoly over competition, arguing that competition kills profits while monopolies can afford to think long-term and innovate.

It all starts with the contrarian challenge: _"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"_
