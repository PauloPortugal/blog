"_Estuaries_"

One of the founding texts of Portuguese neorealism, published in 1941 and censored by the Estado Novo regime, it is a masterpiece of social criticism.

The novel tells the harsh story of lower-class boys who, due to their social status, are forced to work in a small brick factory instead of studying. 

Dedicated to "The sons of men who were never children," it is a devastating critique of the social conditions of the Estado Novo era and its numerous inequalities.
