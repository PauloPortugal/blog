_"Tainted Love"_

A disturbing and necessary novel that explores domestic violence from the chilling perspective of the aggressor who justifies and legitimizes his acts.

Two brothers narrate the story of a family's dissolution. Pedrosa's writing is colloquial, simple, and devastatingly direct, hitting like a punch in the stomach.

Intense, uncomfortable, and necessary reading that affirms Ana Bárbara Pedrosa as a serious force in contemporary Portuguese literature.
