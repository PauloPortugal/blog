_"Own Voice: Jorge Ginja and Mário Viegas - Poetry, Resistance and Freedom"_

A remarkable time capsule containing previously unreleased recordings of the legendary Portuguese actor Mário Viegas, made by Jorge Ginja in 1969 when Viegas was only 21 years old.

The recordings were made when Ginja, about to go to war, asked to use Viegas' voice to recite poems she wanted to take with her.

The book brings together 49 texts by different authors including Alexandre O'Neill, José Carlos Ary dos Santos and Manuel Alegre. Each text features a QR code to access Viegas' recitations on a mobile phone.
