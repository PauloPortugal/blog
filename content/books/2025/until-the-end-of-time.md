Full disclosure: I am a Brian Greene fan. Additional disclosure: I am a passionate about space, astronomy and physics.

Brian Greene employs the Empire State Building as a vivid metaphor to illustrate the passage of time and the potential evolution of the universe.

As we reach the pinnacle of the building, it reflects the ultimate fate of the universe, whether it be entropy, collapse, or rebirth, challenging readers to consider humanity's place (or the absence of it) in these future scenarios.

And yes... the second law of Thermodynamics is a recurring reminder of a universe governed by entropy.
