An autobiographical graphic novel, in the style of Guy Delisle, about Beaton's time working in Alberta's (Canada) oil sands to pay off student debt. 
This is a book about sexual harassment and misogyny. About women working in a men's world.

A MUST read for all, especially men.

Named after a disaster where hundreds of ducks died in toxic tailings ponds, "the book draws devastating parallels between environmental and human degradation".

It also provides a window into the imbalances of the Canadian economy and one of it's most profitable sectors.

Barack Obama named it a favourite of 2022.
