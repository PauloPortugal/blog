Winner of the 2023 Booker Prize, this dystopian novel follows a Dublin mother trying to save her family as Ireland descends into totalitarianism. 

There are echos of Orwell's "Animal Farm" and "1984" and captures a chilling landscape of political turmoil that resonates 
deeply with today's sociopolitical climate, especially in the context of the Trump administration's second term and recent events in Minnesota. 

Lynch's stylistic writing has no paragraph breaks and dialogue without quotation marks which reminded me of the Portuguese Nobel Prize winner José Saramago. 

A brilliant, haunting literary manifesto about a democratic society falling prey of autocratic totalitarianism.
