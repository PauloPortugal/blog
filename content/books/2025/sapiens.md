This ia a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution that became a global phenomenon.

Harari argues that Homo Sapiens' rise to dominance stemmed from our ability to create fictional constructs and how they shape human societies, focusing on three key elements: religion, nations, and money.

His provocative claim that the Agricultural Revolution, the transition from Foraging to Farming, was for a brief time a painful hurdle our conventional thinking.
He also emphasizes the critical role of storytelling and sharing narratives in the evolution of our species.

A well written and engaging thought-provoking book about the evolution of Homo Sapiens'.
