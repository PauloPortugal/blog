Recommended my a dear (Canadian) friend of mine, this is a graphic novel documenting the author's, Guy Delisle. two months in Pyongyang while working for a French animation company.

I decided to order a second hand copy after seeing the asking price between £2-£3, reading it for the second time. 

Delisle is a master of capturing the surreal interaction with it's North Korean citizens in addition to its bureaucracy, propaganda, and tightly controlled reality through humour and sarcasm.
A rare snapshot into the world's most isolated nation.
