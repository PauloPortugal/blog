Winner of the 2024 Booker Prize, this novel follows six astronauts over 24 hours on the International Space Station, over 16 orbits, which centres on the evolving devastating storm in the Philippines focusing on the relationships of the Austronaurs and Cosmonauts aboard the ISS and of their family on Earth.

With just over 120 pages, suggesting the novel can be read rather quickly, in fact requires a careful consideration, making it a profound meditative experience, highlighting just how fragile our planet and our human connections are.
